abstract = {Fishery bycatch is a serious threat to several protected, endangered, and threatened species (PETs), requiring urgent action to develop and implement conservation measures. This study performs an Ecological Risk Assessment for the Effects of Fishing (ERAEF) using a spatially and temporally Productivity–Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) to calculate the potential risk to great shearwaters (Ardenna gravis) from direct interaction with the metiers of the artisanal tuna fishing fleet at the Bay of Biscay (baitboats and trollers). The PSA incorporates productivity attributes based on the Fecundity Factor Index; and susceptibility attributes calculated from the species spatio-temporal abundance patterns obtained developing density surface models and distribution and intensity of fishing activity based on pooled Vessel Monitoring System and logbook data. The PSA shows an overall moderate risk to great shearwaters by the artisanal tuna fishery also revealing that baitboats are less risky than trollers (risk score of 3.12 ± 0.09 and 2.70 ± 0.05, respectively). Spatially, the likelihood of presence of high potential risk areas was associated with prey availability for both the PET and the commercial fish species. The systematic, repeatable, and standardized ERAEF followed in this study can be used to advice for ecosystem-based fisheries management to improve management measures for reducing bycatch of PETs around the world.},

abstract = {Different fishing strategies have been adopted in the last decades by tropical tuna purse seiners fleet, including fish aggregating device (FAD) and free-swimming school (FSC) fishing strategies, which has raised issues about the different carbon footprint of those fishing modes. Here we show the activity and energy patterns of a Spanish tuna purse seiner operating in the tropical Indian Ocean, based on the monitoring of energy consumption over 10 consecutive fishing trips; and we also assess the fuel use intensity of FAD versus FSC fishing by analysing 14 further trips of different tropical tuna purse seiners. The average time of a fishing trip lasted 33.1 ± 11 days. The dominant activity during the fishing trip was cruising (with 68.5% of the time), followed by inactive period at sea (15.6%), fishing (7.7%), and in port (8.1%). The vessel consumed 381 ± 113 t fuel/trip, of which 90.4% was spent in cruising, 4.3% in fishing, 3.7% during the inactive period at night and 1.6% while staying in port. The main engine consumed 75% of the total fuel, while the auxiliary engines the remaining 25%. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that FAD fishing (543.6 L/t) is more fuel intensive, than FSC fishing (439.4 L/t). However, FADs fishing successful rates are higher, around 95.7 ± 3.8%, than FSC rates (around 80.6% ± 5.8). It is worth noting that the differences may be driven by seasonality and FSC availability, number of FADs in an area, vessel characteristics and equipment, and skipper skills rather than the adopted fishing strategy. Nonetheless both FAD and FSC fishing are more energy efficient than longline (1069 L/t), trolling (1107 L/t), or pole and line (1490 L/t) fisheries for Atlantic tuna, but similar or slightly less efficient than Maldivian pole and liners.},

abstract = {Large scale convergence regions of floating marine litter are commonly observed in semi-enclosed seas as the Bay of Biscay. However, clean-up activities on such accumulation regions are limited by the spread of the large-size floating litter on the sea surface. Data gathered by a small-scale fishing vessel devoted to active fishing for floating litter activities during the spring and summer of 2018 reveals that the linear streaks of high concentration of floating litter (so-called litter “windrows”) are common accumulation structures in the south-east coast of the Bay of Biscay. The random search of litter windrows for their collection through surface tows of macro-nets was proved to be an effective action for floating litter mitigation. A total of 196 tows collected 16.2 tons of floating marine litter in 68 working days. Most of the litter windrows were around 1 km length and, on average, accumulated 77.75 kg of floating marine litter. Fishing, shipping and aquaculture sectors were the source of 35% of the 4,130 litter items analyzed (55% in weight of the sourced items), and plastic was the most common type of material (96% in terms of items). A better understanding of the phenomenon of the litter windrows, capable to guide clean-up efforts in space and time, would provide a considerable improvement in the efficiency of mitigation actions to reduce the marine litter pollution. The observations of litter windrows in the coastal area of the south-east of the Bay of Biscay demonstrate the key role of submesoscale processes in the distribution of FML. The present work provides a thorough description of floating litter windrows in nature, which it was non-existent to date. The results are the kind of proof necessary to boost the research addressed on the submesoscale aggregations of FML. Coupling litter windrows observations with remote-sensing technology and high-resolution modeling techniques offer great opportunities for the mitigation actions against marine litter.},

abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are increasingly being used world-wide for the conservation and management of wildlife. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) aims at ensuring biodiversity persistence while minimizing the threats faced by the species and/or the economic costs related to protection. To account for spatio-temporal interactions between species and human threats, conservation planning for mobile wildlife requires time-series data derived from monitoring of species and human threats, a process that is costly and technically challenging. Therefore, assessments of the monitoring period needed to ensure sufficient data input in the design of efficient, adequate and representative networks of PAs are crucial. We demonstrated the value of time-series data in conservation planning by implementing SCP and data from different monitoring periods to identify priority conservation areas for highly mobile marine megafauna accounting for their main threat: commercial fishing. Two analyses of 10 reserve-design scenarios each, replicated as many times as the data composing each scenario permitted were run in Marxan. The best solutions of the planning scenarios were statistically compared using the Cohen's Kappa test. We also assessed differences in spatial similarity among and within scenarios using the Wilcoxon nonparametric test and a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis. Finally, we compared the necessary cost and the area selected for each scenario. Our study highlights the importance of time-series ecological and socioeconomic data for the robust selection of priority conservation areas. The results revealed different thresholds of the minimum temporal data required to design efficient networks of PAs for highly mobile species, demonstrating that the incorporation of data covering longer periods to the scenarios produce a more robust selection of priority conservation areas. Conservation plans using data covering <3 years were missing important priority areas. Synthesis and applications. We provide a method for estimating the minimum number of years of monitoring required to design efficient networks of protected areas that ensure the persistence of highly mobile species such as cetaceans and seabirds. This method can be used within an adaptive management framework to evaluate whether a network of protected areas performs as planned, and to test whether management strategies should be altered or adjusted in response to local and global changes.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Inc. In regression, a predictive model which is able to anticipate the output of a new case is learnt from a set of previous examples. The output or response value of these examples used for model training is known. When learning with aggregated outputs, the examples available for model training are individually unlabeled. Collectively, the aggregated outputs of different subsets of training examples are provided. In this paper, we propose an iterative methodology to learn linear models from this type of data. In spite of being simple, its competitive performance is shown in comparison with a straightforward solution and state-of-the-art techniques. A real world problem is also illustrated which naturally fits the aggregated outputs framework: the estimation of marine litter beaching along the south-east coastline of the Bay of Biscay.},
